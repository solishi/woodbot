This example illustrates using polling for digital input, analog input, and
analog latches.
A switch is used to turn an LED on and off, and a potentiometer sets the
intensity of a second LED.
When the potentiometer exceeds a raw value of 1000, the program is terminated.

There are some major problems with PySerial 2.7 running on Python 3.4.
Polling should only be used with Python 2.7
