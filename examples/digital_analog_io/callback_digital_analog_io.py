This example illustrates using callbacks for digital input, analog input and
analog latches, in addition to demonstrating both writing to an LED using PWM
and with digital outputs.

A switch is used to turn an LED on and off, and a potentiometer sets the
intensity of a second LED. When the potentiometer exceeds a raw value of
1000, the program is terminated.
